  Command Bar 🐝
</h1>

<p align="center">
  <strong>⌘K command bar web component</strong>
</p>

- 🚀 Fast, efficient, keyboard driven UX
- 🍦 Vanilla JS, native web component that works everywhere
- 😌 Opinionated: it doesn't do much, but what it does is very easy to use
- 👌 Fully typed and tested

## Installation

From a CDN:

```ts
import { CommandBar } from "https://esm.sh/gh/andreasphil/command-bar@<tag>";
```

With a package manager:

```sh
npm i github:andreasphil/command-bar#<tag>
```

## Usage

Import the styling for the command bar in your app:

```ts
@import "@andreasphil/design-system/style.css" layer(theme);
@import "@andreasphil/command-bar/style.css";
```

Then import the component and `define` it:

```ts
import { CommandBar } from "@andreasphil/command-bar";

CommandBar.define();
```

After that, the component will be available in the HTML:

```html
<command-bar></command-bar>
```

If a command bar is present in the DOM, you can access it globally via `CommandBar.instance`. This will provide you with methods for registering and removing commands, as well as opening the bar manually:

```ts
import { CommandBar } from "@andreasphil/command-bar";

// This will be returned by the method for registering commands. We can use
// this to clean up commands only needed by specific components/views when
// the user navigates away from those.
let cleanup;

cleanup = CommandBar.instance.registerCommand({
  id: "a_command",
  name: "A command",
  // See the Command type for all available options
});
```

### API

See [commandBar.d.ts](./dist/commandBar.d.ts) for all available methods and docs.
